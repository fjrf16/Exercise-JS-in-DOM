# Introduction

In this project it has been done by having two inputs and two buttons, which have functionalities on the page content by inclusion of JS.

## Functionality

Using the inputs you can enter content to either create 4 column elements at a time or delete a specific column using its position index.

With the first button "create col" you can create columns of different sizes, one at a time and with the second one "eliminar col" you can delete the last column created.
